# Given a binary tree

#     struct TreeLinkNode {
#       TreeLinkNode *left;
#       TreeLinkNode *right;
#       TreeLinkNode *next;
#     }
# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

# Note:

# You may only use constant extra space.
# You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
# For example,
# Given the following perfect binary tree,
#          1
#        /  \
#       2    3
#      / \  / \
#     4  5  6  7
# After calling your function, the tree should look like:
#          1 -> NULL
#        /  \
#       2 -> 3 -> NULL
#      / \  / \
#     4->5->6->7 -> NULL
